    "We have seen the main structures/objects (e.g. `list`, `dictionary`) during the last lecture as well as methods attached to those (e.g. `list.append(val)`). We have also seen how to build functions (kind of scripts that allow you to automatize some sequences of operations). \n",
    "\n",
    "If you quit from the Python interpreter and enter it again, the definitions you have made (functions and variables) are lost. Therefore, if you want to write a somewhat longer program, you are better off using a text editor to prepare the input for the interpreter and running it with that file as input instead. This is known as creating a script. As your program gets longer, you may want to split it into several files for easier maintenance. You may also want to use a handy function that you’ve written in several programs without copying its definition into each program.\n",
    "\n",
    "To support this, Python has a way to put definitions in a file and use them in a script or in an interactive instance of the interpreter. Such a file is called a module; definitions from a module can be imported into other modules or into the main module (the collection of variables that you have access to in a script executed at the top level and in calculator mode).\n",
    "\n",
    "A module is a file containing Python definitions and statements. The file name is the module name with the suffix `.py` appended. When you want to make use of a module in a program or in an interactive window, you should simply do: \n",
    "``` python\n",
    "import module\n",
    "```\n",
    "Then, you call functions in you script simply by doing `module.funtion()`. \n",
    "\n",
    "** Example **: \n",
    "In file `myawesomemodule.py`, we have written\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "def talk():\n",
    "    print 'What do you want master ?'\n",
    "    return\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, in Ipython/Jupyter, you can simply do: \n",
    "``` python \n",
    "import myawesomemodule\n",
    "myawesomemodule.talk()   # call the function talk() you have defined in myawesomemodule.py\n",
    "    Out: 'What do you want master ?'\n",
    "\n",
    "# you can also do this the following way\n",
    "import myawesomemodule as ms\n",
    "ms.talk()\n",
    "\n",
    "# or, if you want to only call the function talk:\n",
    "from myawesomemodule import talk\n",
    "talk()\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",

    "In python, there is `.pyc` files often generated with the same name as the module/~~script~~ you are importing/~~running~~. Imagine you have a module `sayhello.py`. When you import your module the first time, a file `sayhello.pyc` will be created, that contains an already-\"byte-compiled\" version of `sayhello.py` to speed up the execution. The modification time of the version of `sayhello.py` used to create `sayhello.pyc` is recorded in `sayhello.pyc`, and the `.pyc` file is ignored if these don't match.

Broadcasting provides a means of vectorizing array operations so that looping occurs in C instead of Python.

    "#### Formatting Strings\n",
    "\n",
    "It often happens that you do not need to save all the decimals of a number, or would like to see it in scientific notation. For that purpose, you need to use the `%` operator to specify the formatting of the variable you want to show at the screen or save in a file. The variable does not appear explicitly in the string but after it in a tuple, preceded by the `%`. Within the string, the `%` operator will be followed by a format string such as `%f` for a float or `%e` for scientific notation. The sequence `'%.2f'%variable` basically tells that the `%` operator converts the variable into a float with 2 digits after the dot. This is generalized to a sequence of variable, by defining the tuple object that contains all the variables to be formatted (but you need to specify the format you want for those, the association between the format and the variable being done easily as you have put your variable into a tuple-object).   \n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "print '%i is the square of %i' %(4.000, 2)\n",
    "    Out: 4 is the square of 2\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here are some commonly used formatting characters:\n",
    "- `%s`: String (or any object with a string representation, like numbers)\n",
    "- `%d` or `%i`: Integers\n",
    "- `%.<number_of_digits>f`: Floating point numbers with fixed number of digits to the right of the dot. \n",
    "- `%.<number_of_digits>e`: scientific notation with fixed number of digits to the right of the dot.\n",
    "You may find more about string formatting in [python 2 documentation](https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#string-formatting).  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: There is another very useful way in python to save \"full objects\" and access and use them latter using all their characteristics. This can be done by importing the `pickle` [module](https://docs.python.org/2/library/pickle.html), or even better (faster) [cPickle]( http://docs.python.org/library/pickle.html#module-cPickle). When you want to write a pickle into a file, simply open your file (`pkl_file = open()`), use `pickle.dump(obj, pkl_file, protocol=-1)`, and close your file (`pkl_file.close()`). To read an object saved in a pickle file, you can follow the same procedure but use `\tobj = pickle.load(pkl_file)` instead of `pickle.dump()`. "

    "For now, we have basically only used in-line coding and reading/writing results at screen/in files. This is nice but for an interactive language one would like to be able to visualise/plot results easily, without using other software. Even better, one would like to be able to generate publishing-quality figures. This capability to visualize data/results with a high flexibility and generate the figures you will present in your paper/report/poster is fortunatelly also one of the strengths of `Python` ... People sometimes complain that generating figures that match exactly what you aim at is not always easy ... This is *partly* true. As you'll see below, you can already do a lot with the basic commands you have access with matplotlib.\n",

A good way to see the matplotlib capabilities is to skim through the [documentation](http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net), and more specifically have a look to the [Thumbnail gallery](http://www.matplotlib.sourceforge.net/gallery.html).

See  [Matplotlib, pylab, and pyplot: how are they related?](http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/faq/usage_faq.html#matplotlib-pylab-and-pyplot-how-are-they-related) for more discussion on this topic.

The values are all in relative units w.r.t. the size of the figure (i.e. 1 is the full width/heigth of the figure).
