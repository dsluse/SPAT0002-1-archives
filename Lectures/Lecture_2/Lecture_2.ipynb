    "We have seen the main structures/objects (e.g. `list`, `dictionary`) during the last lecture as well as methods attached to those (e.g. `list.append(val)`). We have also seen how to build functions (kind of scripts that allow you to automatize some sequences of operations). \n",
    "\n",
    "If you quit from the Python interpreter and enter it again, the definitions you have made (functions and variables) are lost. Therefore, if you want to write a somewhat longer program, you are better off using a text editor to prepare the input for the interpreter and running it with that file as input instead. This is known as creating a script. As your program gets longer, you may want to split it into several files for easier maintenance. You may also want to use a handy function that you’ve written in several programs without copying its definition into each program.\n",
    "\n",
    "To support this, Python has a way to put definitions in a file and use them in a script or in an interactive instance of the interpreter. Such a file is called a module; definitions from a module can be imported into other modules or into the main module (the collection of variables that you have access to in a script executed at the top level and in calculator mode).\n",
    "\n",
    "A module is a file containing Python definitions and statements. The file name is the module name with the suffix `.py` appended. When you want to make use of a module in a program or in an interactive window, you should simply do: \n",

    "``` python \n",

The modification time of the version of `sayhello.py` is used to create `spam.pyc` is recorded in `sayhello.pyc`, and the `.pyc` file is ignored if these don't match.

Broadcasting provides a means of vectorizing array operations so that looping occurs in C instead of Python.

This is nice but for an interactive language one would like to be able to visualise/plot results easily, without using other software. Even better, one would like to be able to generate publishing-quality figures. This capability to visualize data/results with a high flexibility and generate the figures you will present in your paper/report/poster is fortunatelly also one of the strengths of `Python` ... People sometimes complain that generating figures that match exactly what you aim at is not always easy ... This is *partly* true.

A good way to see the matplotlib capabilities is to skim through the [documentation](http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net), and more specifically have a look to the [Thumbnail gallery](http://www.matplotlib.sourceforge.net/gallery.html).

    "#### V.2 Function minimization and fitting: `scipy.optimize`\n",
    "\n",
    "Optimization of a function is an important aspect of many data analysis problems. The `scipy.optimize` module provides useful algorithms for function minimization (scalar or multi-dimensional), curve fitting and root finding. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will focus here on one of the most used application of minimization techniques which is $\\chi^2$ minimization, namely curve fitting. As you know, curve fitting consists in minimizing the *weighted sum of the squared residuals* (i.e. residuals being the difference between the model and the data):    \n",
    "$\\chi^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\left( \\frac{y_i - f(x_i)}{\\sigma_i} \\right)^2$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: If you are not too familiar with curve fitting/least square minimization, how to do when you have errors also on the independant variable (namely x), about difference between linear and non linear least-square (i.e. applied to linear and non linear models), about the basic concept behind the least square fitting algorithm ... I advise you to consult[Numerical recipes in C](http://www2.units.it/ipl/students_area/imm2/files/Numerical_Recipes.pdf) (Chapters 10, 15), and [Hogg, Bovy, Lang 2010](https://arxiv.org/abs/1008.4686). We can also have a dedicated lecture on this topic (*Let me know*). "
