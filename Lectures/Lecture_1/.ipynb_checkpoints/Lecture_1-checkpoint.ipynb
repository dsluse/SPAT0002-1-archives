Whereas some programming languages, such as MATLAB and R, focus on mathematical and statistical operations, Python is a general-purpose language, along the lines of C and C++ (the languages in which much commercial software and operating systems are written). As such, it is perhaps more complicated, Brown says, but also more capable: it is amenable to everything from automating small sets of instructions, to building websites, to fully fledged applications.\""

    "\n",
    "The inventor of this language is the Dutch programer Guido Van Rossum. It was conceptualized in the late 1980s. Guido van Rossum worked at that time in a project called Amoeba, a distributed operating system. He programmed in a language called ABC but was not fully happy with that language. \n",
    "In an interview with Bill Venners (January 2003 ; http://www.python-course.eu/history_and_philosophy.php), Guido van Rossum said: \n",
    "> \"I remembered all my experience and some of my frustration with ABC. I decided to try to design a simple scripting language that possessed some of ABC's better properties, but without its problems. So I started typing. I created a simple virtual machine, a simple parser, and a simple runtime. I made my own version of the various ABC parts that I liked. I created a basic syntax, used indentation for statement grouping instead of curly braces or begin-end blocks, and developed a small number of powerful data types: a hash table ( or dictionary, as we call it), a list, strings, and numbers. \" \n",
    "\n",
    "... and as explained in another interview, this started as an holiday occupation. In 1996, Van Rossum said ( https://www.python.org/doc/essays/foreword/ ): \n",
    "> Over six years ago, in December 1989, I was looking for a \"hobby\" programming project that would keep me occupied during the week around Christmas. My office ... would be closed, but I had a home computer, and not much else on my hands. I decided to write an interpreter for the new scripting language I had been thinking about lately: a descendant of ABC that would appeal to Unix/C hackers. I chose Python as a working title for the project, being in a slightly irreverent mood (and a big fan of Monty Python's Flying Circus).\n",

    "Programming languages are generally categorized in two classes: *compiled* and *interpreted*. `python` may be seen as an *interpreted* language (although at some level it is *compiled*). One speaks of **compiled** language when a code is executed natively through the operating system after an operation, called *compilation* that converts the original code into a code natively understandable by the machine. *Instead*, when the code is evaluated line by line through another program (which is NOT the OS) which handles its execution (in principle this execution is done in a language natively understood by the machine, also called *low-level* language) via *interpretation*, one speaks of an ** interpreted** language. \n",

This is an add-on package that adds many features to the default Python shell, including the ability to edit and navigate the history of previous commands, as well as the ability to tab-complete variable and function names. You can also write several commands one after the other before executing them by typing `Ctrl Enter` between each command instead of `Enter`. `IPython` allows you also to use any shell command by preceding it with a `!` as we did at the beginning of this Notebook.

    "\n",
    "One way to remember how slices work is to think of the indices as pointing between characters, with the left edge of the first character numbered 0. Then the right edge of the last character of a string of n characters has index n, for example:\n",
    "``` python\n",
    " +---+---+---+---+---+---+\n",
    " | P | y | t | h | o | n |\n",
    " +---+---+---+---+---+---+\n",
    " 0   1   2   3   4   5   6\n",
    "-6  -5  -4  -3  -2  -1\n",
    "```\n",
    "The first row of numbers gives the position of the indices 0...6 (hereabove, in the string `'python'`); the second row gives the corresponding negative indices. The slice from i to j consists of all characters between the edges labeled i and j, respectively.  \n",
    "\n",
    "By calling item \\# i, one gets the item at the right side of i. This is why calling item `n` of a list or string or (...) of size `n` will result an error message: there is no item on the right side of position `n` (n=6 in the example above).   \n",
    "\n",
    "For non-negative indices, the length of a slice is the difference of the indices, if both are within bounds. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notes**: \n",
    "- A list is an *[iterable](https://docs.python.org/2/glossary.html#term-iterable)*, which means that one can iterate over the elements of a list. (`list.__iter__()`). This also means that there is special *methods* that allow you to get e.g. its length (`list.__len__()` or `len(list)`). \n",
    "- Contrary to a `string`, a `list` is mutable, which means that you can replace values of elements, or even clear elements of a list. For example `L[2:4] = []`, will clear elements \\#2 and \\#3 of list `L`.    \n",
    "- *Slicing* in `python` works for any *[sequence](https://docs.python.org/2/glossary.html#term-sequence)* type  object. This includes built-in iterables (i.e. `string`, `list`, `tuple`), but also non iterable objects such as `dict` whose length can also be accessed with method `len()`. "

    "### III.f  Functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "We have seen the first bricks of python coding, but once it is necessary to automate some task, it becomes convenient to define **functions**. A function is a kind of \"mini-script\" that can accept (optionally) one or several parameters. Here is how you define a function:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "def moffat1D(r, I, alpha, beta):\n",
    "    arg = (r / alpha)**2 + 1\n",
    "    y = I / arg**(beta)\n",
    "    return y\n",

    "This function the value of a Moffat profile/function at position `r`:   \n",
    "$ y = I_0  \\left( \\left ( \\frac{r}{\\alpha} \\right )^2 +1 \\right)^{-\\beta}$\n",
    "\n",
    "This Moffat profile is characterized by the parameters `I`, a normalization factor, `alpha`, the width of the moffat, or rather a scale parameter, and `beta`, a parameter governing the shape of the profile. When $\\beta = 1$, the Moffat profile is identical to a Lorentz \"profile\".    \n",
    "\n",
    "The characteristics of a functions are:\n",
    "- They start with the 'def' keyword, followed by the function name\n",
    "- The argument of the function is in parentheses \n",
    "- After the parentheses, starts a colon `:` which marks the beginning of the code block corresponding to your operation. \n",
    "- The code block associated with the function is **indentated** w.r.t. the main text. This is a *very important* property the python language: indentation (with tabulation or 4-spaces -4-spaces are officially recommended by many python-friendly editors convert your tab into space within your code.) are part of the code, they help legibility BUT not only. They tell the code that something special is happening. \n",
    "- In the above code, a **local variable** (you won't have access to it outside your function) `arg` has been defined\n",
    "- The function ends when new code is NOT idented or when a `return` statement is encountered.\n",
    "- There is some rules regarding function arguments:\n",
    "    * First argument(s) of a function should be mandatory arguments, with no default value. \n",
    "    * Next argument(s) are optional arguments for which you give default values\n",
    "    * You cannot put an arugment without default value *after* one with a default value. \n",
    "    * Arguments without default value are positional ones, so if you define `def f(a):`, you do no have to specify the keyword of the function when giving it a value. i.e. `f(0)` will evaluate the function at 0, but `f(a=0)` will also work. On the other hand `f(0, a=0)` will return an Error !\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:**\n",
    "- `Python` has many built-in functions (some are called methods when they are defined in some objects-classes). For example, the function `range(5)` returns a sequential list of integers.\n",
    "- Python 3 disallows mixing the use of tabs and spaces for indentation. Python 2 code indented with a mixture of tabs and spaces should be converted to using spaces exclusively. \n",
    "- When a final formal parameter of the form `**name` (often `**kwargs` is used) is present, it receives a dictionary containing all keyword arguments except for those corresponding to a formal parameter. This may be combined with a formal parameter of the form `*name` (`*args`) which receives a tuple containing the positional arguments beyond the formal parameter list. (`*name` must occur before `**name`.)"

    "\n",
    "#### if statements\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic syntax for an if-statement is the following:\n",
    "``` python \n",
    "if condition:\n",
    "    # do something\n",
    "elif condition:\n",
    "    # do something else\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    # do yet something else\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that there is no statement to end the `if` statement. Notice also the presence of a colon (:) after each control flow statement. Python relies on indentation and colons to determine whether it is in a specific block of code. For example, in the following example:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python \n",
    "if a == 1:\n",
    "    print(\"a is 1, changing to 2\")\n",

    "\n",
    "The conditions in the statements can be anything that returns a boolean value. For example, `a == 1`, `b != 4`, and `c <= 5` are valid conditions because they return either `True` or `False` depending on whether the statements are true or not. Standard comparisons can be used (`==` for equal, `!=` for not equal, `<=` for less or equal, `>=` for greater or equal, `<` for less than, and `>` for greater than), as well as logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`). Parentheses can be used to isolate different parts of conditions, to make clear in what order the comparisons should be executed, for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "if (a == 1 and b <= 3) or c > 3:\n",
    "    # do something\n",
    "```\n",

    "More generally, any function or expression that ultimately returns `True` or `False` can be used.\n",

    "- 4 spaces are a good compromise between small indentation (allows greater nesting depth) and large indentation (easier to read). Tabs introduce confusion, and are best left out.\n",
    "- Wrap lines so that they don’t exceed 79 characters. This helps users with small displays and makes it possible to have several code files side-by-side on larger displays.\n",
    "- Use blank lines to separate functions and classes, and larger blocks of code inside functions.\n",
    "- When possible, put comments on a line of their own.\n",
    "- Use docstrings.\n",
    "- Use spaces around operators and after commas, but not directly inside bracketing constructs: `a = f(1, 2) + g(3, 4)`.\n",

    "Project Jupyter was born out of the IPython project. It started as Ipython notebook but evolved to be a multi-language notebook environment. The name Jupyter is an indirect acronyum of the three core languages it was designed for: **JU**lia, **PYT**hon, and **R**. So it is not because of its \"planet's\" sounding (the acronym has been designed for this !) that I have picked it up for this class ... but because this is a very useful tool and handy way to use python. As it is a notebook, you keep track of everything you want which is an important feature for:     \n",

These would be scripts you have developped and that are e.g. quite demanding in memory, perform long and/or complex calculation, or maybe need to be run on a powerful machine (which is not your Desktop). Use of GUI is also recommended (in my opinion) to write you functions/packages and debug them. For this, there is IDE (Interactive Development environment) that provides you with editor, debuger, (i-)python consoles, command history consoles, help windows, \"variable\" properties consoles, ...  \n",
