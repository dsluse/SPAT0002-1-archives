    "\n",
    "1. Define a posterior $p(\\theta~|~D, I)$\n",
    "2. Define a *proposal density* $p(\\theta_{i + 1}~|~\\theta_i)$, which must be a symmetric function, but otherwise is unconstrained (a Gaussian is the usual choice).\n",
    "3. Choose a starting point $\\theta_0$\n",

    "\n",
    "   1. Given $\\theta_i$, draw a new $\\theta_{i + 1}$ from the proposal distribution\n",

    "   \n",
    "   4. If $a < 1$, then accept the point with probability $a$: this can be done by drawing a uniform random number $r$ and checking if $a < r$. If the point is accepted, add $\\theta_{i + 1}$ to the chain. If not, then add $\\theta_i$ to the chain *again*.\n",
