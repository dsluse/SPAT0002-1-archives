    "- Points in $\\Omega$, are called **realisations** (or sometimes also **sample outcomes**) $\\omega$. \n",
    "- An **Event** is a subset of $\\Omega$ (i.e. a subsample of the $\\omega$).\n",
    "- $p(A)$ is the **probability** of an event A. ($p(A)$ can also refer to a probability that a value of $x$ falls in a d$x$ wide interval around $x$. )\n",

    "**Example**: We measure the magnitude $m$ of a variable star. Then $\\Omega = {\\rm I\\!R}$ (or some plausible range such as $]-30, 40 [ $, but this makes little difference in practice and $\\Omega$ can in general be larger than needed). $\\omega$ is a value in $\\Omega$. While an event is the ensemble of magnitude measurements that are e.g. such that $m_i > 15$ and $m_i <=15.5$, hence this *event* is A = ]15, 15.5]. Note that an event *can* also be a single point (i.e. A = [17.]). \n",
    "\n",
    "To qualify as a probability, $p(A)$ must satisfy the three following axioms (also called [Kolmogorov](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andre%C3%AF_Kolmogorov) axioms):\n",
    "1. $p(A) > 0$ for each A. \n",
    "2. $p(\\Omega) = 1$\n",
    "3. If ($A_1, A_2, A_3, ...$ are disjoint events), then   \n",

    "$$\n",
    "where $\\cup$ stands for **union**. \n",
    "\n",
    "As a consequence of these axioms, several useful rules can be derived such as the *sum rule*:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p(A \\cup B) = p(A) + p(B)-p(A \\cap B)\n",

    "A less formal definition is simply that a random variable is a variable whose value results from the measurement of a quantity that is subject to random variations. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** You roll a dice. You can then define $X(\\omega)$ be the *number of times you draw an even number* in a sequence $\\omega$. Imagine you have rolled your dice 10 times, and get  $\\omega = {1, {\\bf 2, 4, 2}, 5, {\\bf 4, 6}, 3, 3, 1 }$. Then $X(\\omega) = 5$ is the value taken by your *random variable* X. \n",
