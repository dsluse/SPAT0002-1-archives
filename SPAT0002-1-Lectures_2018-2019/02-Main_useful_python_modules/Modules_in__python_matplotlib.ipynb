    "\n",
    "For now, we have basically only used in-line coding and reading/writing results at screen/in files. This is nice but for an interactive language one would like to be able to visualise/plot results easily, without using other software. Even better, one would like to be able to generate publishing-quality figures. This capability to visualize data/results with a high flexibility and generate the figures you will present in your paper/report/poster is fortunatelly also one of the strengths of `Python` ... People sometimes complain that generating figures that match exactly what you aim at is not always easy ... This is *partly* true. As you'll see below, you can already do a lot with the basic commands you have access with matplotlib.\n",
    "\n",
    "*What is `matplotlib` ?* Matplotlib is a python 2-d plotting library which produces publication quality figures in a variety of formats and interactive environments across platforms. Matplotlib can be used in Python scripts, the Python and IPython shell, web application servers, and six graphical user interface toolkits. A good way to see the matplotlib capabilities is to skim through the [documentation](http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net), and more specifically have a look to the [Thumbnail gallery](http://www.matplotlib.sourceforge.net/gallery.html). See the Section [References](#VI) of this notebook to find more specific links to Matplotlib documentation.\n",

    "``` python\n",
    "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
    "```\n",
    "This package gives you access to set of commands that are similar to `MATLAB` commands. \n",
    "In addition, within a `JuPyter` notebook, you may want to see your figure within your notebook. For this purpose, you need (e.g. at the begining of your notebook, or before making your first figure) use the `magic` command\n",

    "You may use another *backend* (a \"program\" that is used behind the scene, in the back of \"python-store\") to plot your figure. Type `%matplotlib -list` to see the various possibilities. One needs to experiment to see what is localy available (while \"inline\" should generally work and allows you to keep your figure in the notebook, which is useful to share your work). If you want to make interactive plots, I advise you to do them within an `IPython` console (but/even if this can be done within jupyter as well, e.g. with `%matplotlib notebook`).  \n",
    "\n",
    "A common option consists in launching Ipython --pylab (or --matplotlib does the same thing nowadays), this is (essentially) equivalent to do `from pylab import *` in your Ipthon window (or in your Jupyter Notebook). In fact, `pylab` is nothing more than a module provided by `matplotlib` that pulls in everything in `matplotlib.pyplot` and a selection of useful functions/modules from matplotlib and numpy. See  [Matplotlib, pylab, and pyplot: how are they related?](http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/faq/usage_faq.html#matplotlib-pylab-and-pyplot-how-are-they-related) for more discussion on this topic. Finally, note that in many examples you will see code like:\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  # set plt as alias for matplotlib.pyplot\n",
    "plt.plot([1,2], [3,4])\n",

    "This is good practice for writing scripts and programs, since it is clear that the plot command is from the `matplotlib.pyplot` package. We’ll adopt this alias for the examples in this course. But once you’re familiar with the commands, you can omit the `plt.` **when plotting in the interactive ipython shell** (but keep it in scripts !) to reduce the amount of typing needed."
