# Cheat Sheets

Cheat sheets dedicated to basic python concepts, but also numpy, scipy, matplotlib, pandas and machine learning modules, have been designed by DataCamp.

You can find them, with many others, on the Datacamp website or on the [kdnugget website](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2017/09/essential-data-science-machine-learning-deep-learning-cheat-sheets.html).
