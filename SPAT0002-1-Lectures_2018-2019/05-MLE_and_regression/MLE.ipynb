    "A common way, in the frequentist sense, to make a point estimation and derive a confidence interval, it through Maximum Likelihood analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing to do in that approach is to choose a model $M(\\theta)$ that is supposed to describe the underlying population from which the data are drawn. This allows one to calculate a likelihood as explained below. \n",
    "\n",
    "### III.1 Likelihood:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The Likelihood $L$ of a model and of its parameters is defined as $L~=~p(D \\,|\\,M(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}))$. Hence, this is the probability of Data given a model (in fact, given a model and its associated set of parameters). \n",
    "When we talk about the likelihoods of different models we are in general talking about the likelihoods of different sets of parameter values. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that a likelihood is not strictly speaking a probability as the sum of all the possible outcomes of a model must sum up to one, while the sum of the likelihood of the models (parameters) needed to explain the data do not have to add up to 1. This can be illustrated using a Gaussian case.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's imagine that we have an ensemble of $N$ *independent* random variable {$x_i$} drawn from a normal (i.e. gaussian) distribution of mean $\\mu$ and width $\\sigma$ (i.e. errors on all the measurements $x_i$ are the same, namely the errors are \"homoscedastic\"). \n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If each measurement is independent of the other, the probability of having a given set of measurements will be proportional to the product of the individual probabilities. The likelihood can then be calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "L \\equiv p(\\{x_i\\} | \\mu, \\sigma ) = \\prod_{i=1}^{N} \\frac{1}{\\sigma \\sqrt{2\\,\\pi}} \\, \\exp\\left[-0.5 \\left (\\frac{x_i - \\mu}{\\sigma} \\right)^2\\right] = \\frac{1}{\\sigma^n (2\\,\\pi)^{n/2}} \\prod_{i=1}^{N} \\exp \\left (\\frac{-(x_i - \\mu)^2}{2\\, \\sigma^2} \\right)\n",

    "If you make a measurement of a random variable and obtain a value $x$, the associated likelihood $L$ can be considered as a function of the data (i.e. the likelihood depends on the data you have obtained). Conversely, you may also consider that you can vary model parameters, and search for the parameters that maximize the likelihood (i.e. maximize the change you have to make that specific measurement). In that case we can say that it is a function of the model."

    "\n",
    "The so called *Maximum Likelihood Approach* used by frequentists (and originally introduced by Fisher -as a third year undegraduate- about 100 years ago), consists in considering the likelihood as a function of the model (parameters) and not as a function of the data. The idea behind the maximization of the likelihood is two fold: i) the probability of any given set of parameters $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$ is proportional to the probability of observing the data (i.e. the likelihood defined above); ii) the most probable set of values of the parameters (of our model) should also be the one that maximizes the probability of obtaining the data. \n",

    "1. **consistency**: This means that they converge to the true value when the size of the sample increases. \n",
    "2. **asymptotically normal** estimator: When the size of the sample increases, the distribution of the parameter estimator $\\hat{\\theta}$ converges towards a normal distribution centered on the MLE, with a certain spread. This spread can often be calculated easily to estimate the uncertainty on $\\hat{\\theta}$.\n",
    "3. **best possible error** given the data. This means that asymptotically, MLE achieve the **theoretical possible minimum of the variance** (Cram√®r-Rao bound). \n",

    "**Warning:** these properties rely on some assumptions regarding i) the model from which are drawn the data (i.e. they are all drawn from the same class of pdf -a gaussian in the model above); ii) regularity conditions that allows some derivative to exists (see Chapter 10 of [Lupton 1993](#LUP93) ).
