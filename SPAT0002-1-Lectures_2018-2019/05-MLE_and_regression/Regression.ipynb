    "Having in hands a set of mutidimensional data, let's say an independent variable $x$, and dependent variable $y$. Then the problem of regression consists in finding the expectation value of $y$ given x, i.e. $E(y|x)$ (i.e. this is a conditional expectation value). This is bread and butter of scientific research. If we have a model for the conditional distribution, we can write $y \\, = \\, f(x\\,|\\,{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}})$ where ${{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}}$ are the parameters of the model. Regression will then consists in finding the parameters $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$ that yields $E(f(x\\,|\\,\\boldsymbol{\\theta}))$. Note here that $x$, the independent variable, does not have to be a random variable, it could be a deterministic variable, such as a deterministic sampling of a time series. \n",

    "- *Complexity*: A large number of independent variables increases the complexity of the error covariance matrix and of the problem solving. For linear models with small/negligible errors on the independent variable, problem complexity is not a severe issue. \n",

Therefore, the model representing the cross validation is likely to be in practice a better model. \n",

    "When the model is **not** anymore linear *in its parameters*, then there is no direct solution through matrix inversion, and it becomes necessary to use purely numerical method. For frequentists, the strategy generally remains to optimize the maximum likelihood estimation, or equivalently minimizing the *weighted sum of the squared residuals* $\\chi^2 \\equiv\\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\left( \\frac{y_i - f(x_i)}{\\sigma_i} \\right)^2$.   \n",

    "\n",
    "A popular and efficient algorithm to find the parameters that minimize your $\\chi^2$ merit function is the so-called Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. Conceptually, that method switches between the \"Gradient Descent Method\" (you perturb the parameters by some amount \"h\" in the direction of steepest descent in your $\\chi^2$ function), and the \"Gauss-Newton Method\" that assumes that locally your function is quadratic in the parameters to determine \"h\", through a \"lagrange parameter\" lambda that is modified depending of the observed change in merit function. \n",
    "\n",
    "In python, you can use the `curve_fit()` function from the `scipy.optimize` to apply levenberg Marquardt to the fit of your function. \n",

    "# there is the possibility to constrain the parameters to certain ranges using method = 'trf'\n",
    "```\n",
    "Note that the argument `absolute_sigma=True` is **mandatory** if you want a correct covariance matrix. By default, `curve_fit` considers relative sigma and rescale the sigma by a multicative factor based on the variance of the residuals (see help of `curve_fit` for details). \n",
    "\n",
    "**Important Note:** There is currently important development of model fitting within the astropy package. Several of the algorithm used are wrapper on algorithms from other packages (such as `numpy` and `scipy.optimize`), so think also \n",
