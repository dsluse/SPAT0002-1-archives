    "## II.4 Bootstrap\n",
    "\n",
    "The bootstrap is a method for estimating standard error (and confidence intervals on some statistical quantities / aka statistics) using your observed sample of random variable to estimate the population distribution of your statistics. \n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine that you have a random variable $x$, and have n measurements $\\{x_i\\}$ of it. Then you may want to measure some statistics (let's say $q = g(x_1, ..., x_n)$) of the pdf of $x$ (e.g. its mean, its median, its variance, ...) and find out how precise is that statistics (i.e. measure the variance or confidence interval associated to that stat.). In general, you do not know the distribution $h(x)$ from which are drawn your data, and therefore you do not know the one of $q$. You only have an estimate $\\hat{h}(x) \\, \\equiv\\, f(x)$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "f(x) \\, = \\, \\frac{1}{n} \\, \\sum_{i=1}^n \\, \\delta(x - x_i),  \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\delta(x)$ is the dirac function. This choice of $f(x)$ is also the one that maximizes the likelihood, i.e. $p(x_i  \\, | \\, f)$. Now that we have an estimator of $h(x)$ we can draw samples from $f(x)$ (as we did when we used Monte-Carlo to derive pdf for virtually infinite samples of random variables), and study the distribution of our statistical quantity (i.e. estimate its variance, confidence interval, ...). This is exactly as we did when we carried out Monte-Carlo simulations *except* that instead of drawing samples from a known pdf $h(x)$ we do it from our estimator of the pdf $f(x)$.    \n",
    "\n",
    "If our sample contains $n$ elements, then, there are $n!$ possible distinct samples of size n we can draw , and a probability $n!/n^n$ that we draw a sample identical to the original data (i.e. for 10 elements, $n!/n^n \\sim 3.6\\,10^{-4}$.).  \n",
    "\n",
    "In practice:\n",
    "- You have: $x=\\{x_1, x_2, ..., x_n\\}$\n",
    "- You then draw $B$ samples $\\{x^*_1, x^*_2, ..., x^*_n\\}$, where $x^*_i$ is randomly picked among the $x$ (with replacements, i.e. it could be that one of your $B$ samples will be $\\{x_1, x_1, ...,x_1\\}$ !). In other words, for each bootstrap sample, you generate random n indices in the range $[1, ..., n]$  (in `python`, you can use `np.random.randint(low, high, size)` or `scipy.random.randint()` to generate n random integers) to build your bootstrap sample from the original sample. \n",
    "- Then, as we did with Monte-Carlo simulations, you can estimate from each of these $B$ samples your statistics $\\hat{q}$ and study its distribution, or more specifically derive its variance, confidence interval, ... \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Sometimes, instead of using $f(x)$ as derived directly from the sample, one uses its \"best fit model\" $f(x \\, | \\, \\hat{\\theta})$, this is then called *parametric bootstrap*.  \n",
    "There is complete books dedicated to bootstraps and its subtleties (especially if the errors on your random variable are not identical, effects related to the size of your sample, ... ). \n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercise:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create a random sample $x$ of $N=100$ measurements drawn from a normal gaussian distribution: `sample = np.random.normal( 0, 1, 100)`. This is assumed to be your data set. Now, calculate a bootstrap estimate of the mean and the associated standard error (on the mean), assuming that *you do not know* that the population is normally distributed. \n",
