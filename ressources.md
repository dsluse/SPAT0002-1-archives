# SPAT0002-1: Ressources and references

Exhaustive list of ressource material and references per topic. Needs futher selection!!

## Software Carpentry

- I would really like to use SOFTWARE CARPENTRY (Creative commons; see also
  https://arxiv.org/abs/1307.5448) material/tutorial for some classes: maybe GIT and some part of
  introduction to python [see https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/reference/ for
  python and here for git https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/reference/ ; links to github below] .Note
  also "online classes for instructors" https://swcarpentry.github.io/instructor-training/ [basics of pedagogy
  and programming ...]

## Git / Github

- Free interactive tutorial for git: https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1
- Paper of Wilson (CARPENTRY) about git and github:
  http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004668
- Phil Marshall: https://github.com/drphilmarshall/GettingStarted#top
- CARPENTY http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/
- Aide memoire Github: https://services.github.com/kit/downloads/fr/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf
- See some link at the bottom of Phil’s page and the simple: see e.g. the step by step page
  https://www.git-tower.com/learn/git/ebook/en/command-line/basics/what-is-version-control#start
- In case: Git-SVN Cheat Sheet: https://git.wiki.kernel.org/images-git/7/78/Git-svn-cheatsheet.pdf

## Shell / Bash

- Introduction to shell https://openclassrooms.com/courses/reprenez-le-controle-a-l-aide-de-linux/introduction-aux-scripts-shell

## Python installation (distributions)

- About Conda and Anaconda: Myths and misconception about this: https://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2016/08/25/conda-myths-and-misconceptions/

## Python programming (general)

- List of python resources useful for beginners: http://foresightr.com/2016/08/23/an-evolving-list-of-python-resources/

## Python for Science

- Plenty of links about data analysis, robotics, machine learning in python https://pythonprogramming.net/
- Computational statistics in Python: http://people.duke.edu/~ccc14/sta-663/index.html

## Python for Astronomy / Astrophysics

- Python for astronomer: https://python4astronomers.github.io/Hands on workshop to explore power of
  python for astronomy application. Quick look does not suggests this is "the way to go": model 1d-2d is
  based on sherpa ; reading-wringing files: fine ; satrapy core function and uses analysis seen elsewhere.
  Not too bad. Regarding satrapy, go for satrapy tutorials http://www.astropy.org/astropy-tutorials/
- Additional ressources: http://www.astropython.org/

## Machine learning (general)

- Nice link to give to the student: http://www.r2d3.us/visual-intro-to-machine-learning-part-1/
- "data challenges" https://www.kaggle.com/
- Minimal implementation of ML algorithms (Python/Numpy), ideal for teachning: https://github.com/rushter/MLAlgorithms

## Python & machine learning applied to Astronomy / Astrophysics

- Book: "Statistics, data mining and Machine learning in astronomy"
- Python tool deep machine learning classification of star and galaxies:
  https://github.com/EdwardJKim/dl4astro and https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.04369
- Galaxy classification in Python using "topometric clustering"
  technique: https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.06728 : code not yet public but "soon" available on github ;
  Deblending between sources and galaxy shape identification is based on "DBscan" (density based
  spatial clustering of applications with noise") while the final classification is using supervised ML
  (random Forest and gradient boosting - comparison of the 2 approaches).
- Identify RFI in radio data and correct for them: Akeret et al. 2016
  https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.09077: code available on github including some python notebooks in demo
  https://github.com/jakeret/tf_unet
