Broadcasting provides a means of vectorizing array operations so that looping occurs in C instead of Python.

    "It often happens that you do not need to save all the decimals of a number, or would like to see it in scientific notation. For that purpose, you need to use the `%` operator to specify the formatting of the variable you want to show at the screen or save in a file. The variable does not appear explicitly in the string but after it in a tuple, preceded by the `%`. Within the string, the `%` operator will be followed by a format string such as `%f` for a float or `%e` for scientific notation. The sequence `'%.2f'%variable` basically tells that the `%` operator converts the `variable` into a float with 2 digits after the dot. This is generalized to a sequence of variable, by defining the tuple object that contains all the variables to be formatted (but you need to specify the format you want for those, the association between the format and the variable being done easily as you have put your variable into a tuple-object).   \n",
