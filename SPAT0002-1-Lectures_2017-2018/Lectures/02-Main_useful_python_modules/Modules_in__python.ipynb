    "We have seen the main structures/objects (e.g. `list`, `dictionary`) during the last lecture as well as methods attached to those (e.g. `list.append(val)`). We have also seen how to build functions (kind of scripts that allow you to automatize some sequences of operations). The  Notebook [Recap_python_L1.ipynb](Recap_python_L1.ipynb) summarizes the main things we have learned. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you quit from the `Ipython` interpreter and enter it again, the definitions you have made (functions and variables) are lost. Therefore, if you want to write a somewhat longer program, you'd better use a text editor to prepare the input for the interpreter and run it with that file as input instead. This is known as creating a script. As your program gets longer, you may want to split it into several files for easier maintenance. You may also want to use a handy function that youâ€™ve written in several programs without copying its definition into each program.\n",
    "\n",
    "To support this, Python has a way to put definitions in a file and use them in a script or in an interactive instance of the interpreter. Such a file is called a module; definitions from a module can be imported into other modules or into the main module (the collection of variables that you have access to in a script executed at the top level and in calculator mode).\n",
    "\n",
    "A module is a file containing Python definitions and statements. The file name is the module name with the suffix `.py` appended. When you want to make use of a module in a program or in an interactive window, you should simply do: \n",
    "``` python\n",
    "import module\n",
    "```\n",
    "Then, you call functions in you script simply by doing `module.funtion()`. \n",
    "\n",
    "** Example **: \n",
    "In file `myawesomemodule.py`, we have written\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "def talk():\n",
    "    print 'What do you want master ?'\n",
    "    return\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, in Ipython/Jupyter, you can simply do: \n",
    "``` python \n",
    "import myawesomemodule\n",
    "myawesomemodule.talk()   # call the function talk() you have defined in myawesomemodule.py\n",
    "    Out: 'What do you want master ?'\n",
    "\n",
    "# you can also do this the following way\n",
    "import myawesomemodule as ms\n",
    "ms.talk()\n",
    "\n",
    "# or, if you want to only call the function talk:\n",
    "from myawesomemodule import talk\n",
    "talk()\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",

    "In python, there is `.pyc` files often generated with the same name as the module/~~script~~ you are importing/~~running~~. Imagine you have a module `sayhello.py`. When you import your module the first time, a file `sayhello.pyc` will be created, that contains an already-\"byte-compiled\" version of `sayhello.py` to speed up the execution. The modification time of the version of `sayhello.py` used to create `sayhello.pyc` is recorded in `sayhello.pyc`, and the `.pyc` file is ignored if these don't match. A program does not run faster when read from a `pyc` instead of a `py`, but **it is loaded** more quickly.  \n",
    "\n",
    "If you have loaded your module in an `Ipython` and then modify it with an editor, it won't account directly for your modifications (because the `pyc` has not been re-compiled).

    "- `PYTHONPATH` (a list of directory names, with the same syntax as the shell variable PATH).\n",
    "- the installation-dependent default.\n",

    "After initialization, Python programs can modify `sys.path`. The directory containing the script being run is placed at the beginning of the search path, ahead of the standard library path. This means that scripts in that directory will be loaded instead of modules of the same name in the library directory. This is an error unless the replacement is intended."

    "*TIP*: You can create your own modules ovbiously, but one of the great asset of python is the availability of a **huge** library of third-party modules, often designed by scientists for scientists (including astronomers !). Some of these modules introduce new structures/objects that you may have to masterize/understand by yourself. There is some modules that **YOU NEED TO KNOW** to efficiently work on data-science related projects: `numpy`, `scipy` and `matplotlib` ...

Matplotlib can be used in Python scripts, the Python and IPython shell, web application servers, and six graphical user interface toolkits. A good way to see the matplotlib capabilities is to skim through the [documentation](http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net), and more specifically have a look to the [Thumbnail gallery](http://www.matplotlib.sourceforge.net/gallery.html).

As non-professional programmers, scientists often tend to re-invent the wheel, which leads to buggy, non-optimal, difficult-to-share and unmaintainable code. By contrast, Scipyâ€˜s routines are optimized and tested, and should therefore be used when possible.\n",
